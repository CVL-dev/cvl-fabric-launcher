DEPENDENCIES FOR MASSIVE LAUNCHER

1. OVERVIEW
2. RECOMMENDED PYTHON VERSION
3. PYTHON MODULES REQUIRED TO RUN MASSIVE LAUNCHER
4. PYTHON MODULES REQUIRED TO BUILD THE BUNDLED DISTRIBUTABLE APPLICATION

1. OVERVIEW

The MASSIVE Launcher is a wxPython application which can be run by typing
"python massive.py" at the command prompt.  It can be built into a Mac OS X
application bundle using py2app, and it can be built into a Windows 
application bundle using py2exe.  Bundling the application in this way
requires additional Python modules - see Section 4.

2. RECOMMENDED PYTHON VERSION

At the time of writing, wxPython doesn't play nicely with 64-bit Python 
versions  on Mac OS X, so installing a 32-bit Python version from Python.Org
is recommended. Since there is no strong reason to produce a 64-bit Launcher
application at this stage, I stick with 32-bit binaries on all platforms.

I use the following Python versions:

Mac OS X: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3-macosx10.3.dmg

Windows: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi

3. PYTHON MODULES REQUIRED TO RUN MASSIVE LAUNCHER

3.1 wx
3.2 setuptools
3.3 pycrypto
3.4 ssh
3.5 appdirs


3.1 wx

The wxPython GUI toolkit can be downloaded from http://wxpython.org/
It is important to match the wxPython version download with the Python version
you are running.  Because I use Python 2.7.x, I download a version of wxPython
including "27" in the filename.

I use the following wxPython versions:

Mac OS X: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-osx-unicode-2.8.12.1-universal-py2.7.dmg

Windows: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe

3.2 setuptools

The setuptools module isn't required to run the launcher, but it is required
to build a Mac application bundle, and it is useful to have installed, so that
other Python modules can be installed using "sudo python setup.py install".

I use version 0.6c11 of setuptools:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.6c11

MS Windows installers are available.  I use: 

Windows: setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe

Mac OS X: setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg

The setuptools module can be installed on Mac OS X by running:

sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg

3.3 pycrypto

I use version 2.3 of the pycrypto module: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto/
which is required by the SSH module: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ssh/

pycrypto can be difficult to build from source on Windows, but you can download
a binary from:
- http://www.voidspace.org.uk/downloads/  OR
- http://blog.victorjabur.com/2011/06/08/modules-python-library-compiled-for-windows-32-and-64-unofficial-windows-binaries-for-python/

On Mac OS X, pycrypto can be downloaded as source from:

http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pycrypto/pycrypto-2.3.tar.gz

If you have an appropriate version of gcc and related tools installed, then
the pycrypto module can be installed using:

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

Building Python modules including C code on Mac OS X requires matching the 
version of gcc used to build the module, with the version of gcc, used to
build Python itself.  If you have installed a cutting edge version of the
Xcode developer tools, then you may find that Python modules fail to build,
because you are running gcc 4.2 in /usr/bin/, but Python itself was built with
gcc 4.0.  To revert back to a less cutting edge version of the Xcode developer
tools, you can refer to his blog article: 
http://macfiets.blogspot.com.au/2011/05/how-to-download-xcode-3.html 
which takes you to the following link: 
http://connect.apple.com/, https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action# 
where you can download the "Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS SDK 4.3" disk image.

If you find that the Xcode application itself refuses to install, and you want
to install it, follow the trick on this page: http://anatomicwax.tumblr.com/post/8064949186/installing-xcode-3-2-6-on-lion-redux

If you are rolling back from gcc 4.2 to gcc 4.0, you will need to fix up the 
symbolic links in /usr/bin/:

cd /usr/bin/
sudo mv gcc gcc.bkp # Make a backup of the old symbolic link.
sudo mv cc cc.bkp # Make a backup of the old symbolic link.
sudo ln -s gcc-4.0  gcc
sudo ln -s gcc-4.0 cc

To ensure that you are building pure 32-bit Intel binaries, and not hybrid
Universal binaries (including the PowerPC architecture as well), set the 
"ARCHFLAGS" environment variable to "-arch i386" before running:
  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

If after all of that hard work, you find that "import pycrypto" doesn't work,
don't worry - the correct module name is "Crypto".  Try "import Crypto".

3.4 ssh

I use version 1.7.14 of the PyPi SSH module, which can be found here: 

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ssh/1.7.14

It contains pure Python code, so its installation doesn't require a C compiler.

It can be installed using:

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

3.5 appdirs

I use version 1.2.0 of the PyPi appdirs module, which can be found here:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/appdirs/1.2.0

It contains pure Python code, so its installation doesn't require a C compiler.

It can be installed using:

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

4. PYTHON MODULES REQUIRED TO BUILD THE BUNDLED DISTRIBUTABLE APPLICATION

4.1 setuptools
4.2 py2app
4.3 py2exe

4.1 setuptools

See section 3.2

4.2 py2app

The py2app module, used by the Launcher's create_mac_bundle.py script, can be
downloaded from here:

http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/py2app/py2app-0.6.4.tar.gz

It can be installed in the usual way:

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

4.3 py2exe

I use version 0.6.9 of the py2exe module with the Launcher's create_windows_bundle.py script.

Version 0.6.9 of py2exe can be downloaded from here:

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/py2exe/py2exe/0.6.9/py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe
